# DavisBase


The goal of this project is to implement a rudimentary database engine that is loosely based on a hybrid between MySQL and SQLite, which is called DavisBase.

It runs entirely from the command line and API calls.

Implemented DDL and DML commands by using a B-Tree mechanism. Stores database files on file-per-table approach.
